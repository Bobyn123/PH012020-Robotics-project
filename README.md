Code and notes related to module practical work

robot dimensions 9.5cmx14.8cm

need to modify movement functions to move specified distance based on the wheel diamater and make use of specific offset values for both servos to have robot move in straight line

final test will be performed on paper surface


data for travel speed:
performed on table
times in s
5.16s
4.86
4.85
5.02
4.86
5.04
4.97
4.84
4.80
4.93
results:
average time of 4.933s to travers 53cm so 9.866s ish to travel 106cm or 9.3s to travel 100cm hence 0.093s to travel 1cm 

data for rotation speed:
5 rotations were measured for each value
results for not carpet
57.04
57.93
58.55
58.79
58.72
average time of 58.206s for one full rotation and time of 0.1616833333s for one degree of rotation or 0.162s for simplicity

Average infraRed sensor range is 24cm
