Code and notes related to module practical work

robot dimensions 9.5cmx14.8cm

data for travel speed:
performed on table
times in s
5.16s
4.86
4.85
5.02
4.86
5.04
4.97
4.84
4.80
4.93
results:
average time of 4.933s to travers 53cm so 9.866s ish to travel 106cm or 9.3s to travel 100cm hence 0.093s to travel 1cm 

data for rotation speed:
5 rotations were measured for each time
performed on carpet
measured in s
// 32.13s
// 32.61
// 33.01
// 33.13
// 33.40
// results:
// average time to rotate 5 times was 32.856s hence an average time of 0.0912666666s to rotates one degree, for reasonableness round to // 0.09s  per 1 degree


ignore the above, movement on carpet is slow af
results for not carpet
57.04
57.93
58.55
58.79
58.72
average time of 58.206s for one full rotation and time of 0.1616833333s for one degree of rotation or 0.162s for simplicity
